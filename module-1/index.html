        <div class="module-space">
            <p>To create a world clock using HTML and JavaScript, you can start by designing the layout of your webpage using HTML, including a container to display the current time. Then, use JavaScript to fetch the current time from the user's device and display it in the designated container. You can achieve this by utilizing the `Date` object in JavaScript to get the current date and time, then updating the content of the container with this information. Additionally, you can add buttons to allow users to view the time in different time zones. When a button is clicked, the JavaScript code can calculate and display the time in the corresponding time zone. This involves converting the current time to the selected time zone using the `getTimezoneOffset()` method and adjusting the displayed time accordingly. Finally, you can style your webpage using CSS to enhance the visual appearance and layout of the world clock..</p>
